## Hi, Mom!

So, I was shopping for domain names one day and found the `.kim` TLD (the letters after the period). I thought: "Huh, thats funny. I bet its already overrun."

It wasnt üòÅ

So I couldn't resist, and picked up the domain for the next two years. You come up with what you would like to use this domain for, and I will make it happen. Some ideas:

#### Write a Blog
Its not that hard to get set up. I would get it all set up for you, then you can write whatever you want.

#### Simple Landing Page
I have one of these. [Here is mine.](https://eatrunco.de). Here are a few more examples. Anything you wamnt, any design. I will make it.

#### Shopify Store
Want to sell something? I will set that up.

#### Just Point It At Something
I can make the domain name point at anything you want. Google? Check. Hamster Dance? Also check.

Love you Mom! Hope you like it!
