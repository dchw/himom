## Hi, Mom!

So, I was shopping for domain names one day and found the `.kim` TLD (the letters after the period). I thought: "Huh, thats funny. I bet its already overrun. Wouldn't it be funny if `larson` was avaliable?"

It was! üòÅ Funnily enough, your [doppelganger had this same idea.](https://larsen.kim)

So I couldn't resist, and picked up the domain for the next two years. You come up with what you would like to use this domain for, and I will make it happen. Some ideas:

#### Write a Blog
Its not that hard to do! I would get it all set up for you, teach you how to use it, and then you can write to your hearts content!

#### Simple Landing Page
I have one of these. [Here is mine.](https://eatrunco.de). Here are a [few](http://www.geschehaas.com/) [more](https://kaysiegarza.com/) [examples](http://www.shannonefranklin.com/). Anything you wamt, any design... I will make it happen.

#### Shopify Store
Want to sell something? I will set that up.

#### Just Point It At Something
I can make the domain name point at anything you would like. Google? Check. Hamster Dance? Also check.

#### I want it all!
That can work too. We can make subdomains. The addresses would look something like this: `photos.larson.kim` or `mysonisthebest.larson.kim`.

Love you Mom! Hope you like it!
